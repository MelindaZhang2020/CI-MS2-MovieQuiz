## User Stories Testing

- As a user, when I enter a website, I want to see a clear visual set up, image and buttons and minimum amount of text on front page. Movie Quiz used a full screen background image and head line and 3 buttons as its main feature on the front page, the visual effect is clear and simple.

- The color contrast is critical to users as be able to read the content on the page is the most important requirement. Movie Quiz used yellow over dark red color theme, it's easy to read and also easy on the eyes.

- As a user, I would like to use other senses rather than just sight, it gives me better experience. Movie Quiz uses aduio throughout the site, background music option on the home page, right/wrong answer sound effect on the game page, and congratulation music when the game ends.

- As a user, when I play a quiz game, I expect the format of questions are well set up. Movie Quiz game page consist question heading area indicating how far the user is in the game, a progress bar for visual effect, updated scores tells how many points they have made so far.

- As a user, I need to know where is clickable, and which choice is my mouse on. Moive Quiz choices have a hover over effect, the choice scales bigger, the border changes color and a box shadow appears when the mouse is hovered over.

- AS a user, I need to know if my answer is right or wrong. Movie Quiz has implemented that need by visual and sound effect. The choice changes to green color if the answer is correct, and red if the answer is incorrect. A dedicated sound is also assigned to both scenarios.

- As a user, I expect quiz game is a bit challenging. Movie Quiz has a timer installed in the game, it only gives the user 60 seconds to select an answer.

- As a user, I expect to go back to quit the game if I decided to. The game page has a option of going back to home page anytime.

- As a user, when I finish the game, I would like to know my final scores. The game automaticly go to the end page when a game is finished and a final score displays.

- As a user, images and music are better experience than plain text. The game finishes with a congratulations music auto plays and an images with encourage words.

- As a user, I want to save my name and my high scores. The end page gives the user the option of saving their names and score in the local storage when a new high score is achieved.

- As a user, I would like the option to play again, if I found the game is interesting and want to do better in the next round. The end page has a button of playing the game again or go home.

- As a user, I would like to check the scores leader board. In the home page, there is a button to check the high scores list of top 5.

- As a user, sometimes I could get annoyed by the music/sound so I want to have the option to switch it off anytime. Throughout all pages when there's sound/music, a button is provided to switch it off anytime.

- As a user, it will be nice to know the developer info. The clickable footer provide this option with the name and social link of the developer.

- The favicon gives a clear indication to the users of what the website is about, and it represent a brand image of the website. And made it easy to spot when the user has other tabs open or bookmark the page.
